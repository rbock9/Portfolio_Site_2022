                    <h2>A Bit About Me:</h2>
                    <p>Iâ€™m Rob Bock, a curious and open-minded software developer with a background in written communication and client-facing business operations... </p>
                    <p>...but you just read that on the Home page! Since I have a bit more space here, I'd like to tell you a little about myself, where I've been, and where I'm hoping to go.</p>
                    <p>I studied journalism in college -- I've always had a knack for writing, and I liked the idea of having a career that demanded investigation, research, and working quickly on creations to engage and excite large audiences. But shortly after graduating I realized that the journalism industry wasn't as fulfilling as I'd imagined, and I'd be better off in a different field with a wider variety of tasks and more room to grow.</p>
                    <p>For the next few years I worked at a custom apparel company called Custom Ink as a Satisfaction Assurance Associate, which was a hybrid role that combined Project Management with Customer Service. It was my job to resolve production issues relating to quality control by proofing designs, coordinating with coworkers in other departments, and reaching out to customers to resolve issues which would prevent their orders from being fulfilled. The highlight of my time at Custom Ink was when I earned a temporary internship with the Site Content department, which is where I first learned how websites are designed, developed, and deployed. Even though I didn't know how to write code, I was captivated by the entire process, and the experience reverberated in the back of my mind long after I returned to my previous position. But, after a few more years at Custom Ink, I found that I'd mastered the responsibilities of my role. Because I wasn't a coder, there weren't many other opportunities for me to advance, and so I decided to move on from the company in search of new challenges.</p>
                    <p>I later worked at a small but rapidly-growing baking company called Whisked, and my job was essentially a jack-of-all trades role where I did whatever tasks were needed to keep production operations running smoothly. I was happy to tackle such a wide array of responsibilities, but I couldn't stop thinking about finding a more permanent job that had everything I'd come to realize I needed... Something fast-paced, with endless opportunities for learning, ample room for growth, and the chance to create projects which would benefit people on a large scale. By this point, the answer was obvious: I should build websites! But first, I had to learn how to code.</p>
                    <p>I parted ways with Whisked in late 2020, and built my first web page shortly after. Needless to say, it was love at first <i>site</i>! I spent all of 2021 learning the many tools and techniques involved in web development, and I was delighted to find that Full-Stack Web Development and Software Engineering were closely intertwined due to various shared technologies. I figured learning both disciplines would maximize my chances of landing a role doing something I loved, so I enrolled in a Software Engineering program with General Assembly, and graduated in December 2021.</p> 
                    <p>The rest of my story is still to be written! But, if you're interested in helping me continue my journey, you can check out my resume <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UasTmB8fMGGtafXISSh4FZrjCh7CXvCQgxtKz2TCDVQ/">here.</a></p>

                    <h2>FAQs:</h2>
                    <p class="underline">Q: What's up with your website?</p>
                    <p>A: Thanks for visiting my portfolio website! You may have noticed it has a fairly, shall we say, "simple" look. This is because I challenged myself to design and build it without using any templates, libraries, or frameworks (excluding font and icon libraries), so what you see is just basic HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript written by yours truly. I consider myself more of a developer than a designer, so I leaned on my desire to make a clean, simple, and efficient website adhering to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" title="KISS principle">KISS principle</a> rather than building something flashy, slow and impractical made from other people's work. That said, this site is an ongoing project, and I'll be sure to add and enhance its features and functionality over the coming months.</p>
                    <p class="underline">Q: How long have you been coding?</p>
                    <p>A: I was first introduced to basic HTML/CSS, graphic design, and flash animation in high school (circa 2006). I later learned a bit more about web development and web content creation during an internship I landed with Custom Ink's Site Content team during winter 2015-2016. However, I didn't begin coding full-time until around December 2020. I spent most of 2021 teaching myself the core languages of the web (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), and then completed an immersive Software Engineering program with General Assembly which lasted from September through December of 2021. I've been learning and coding at least a few hours a day ever since!</p>
                    <p class="underline">Q: What's your favorite coding language?</p>
                    <p>A: Definitely JavaScript. There's just so much you can do with it, even outside a web browser. It was the first scripting language I studied, and I find myself "thinking in JavaScript" to work through problems even when writing code in other languages like Python.</p>
                    <p class="underline">Q: Why should I hire you?</p>
                    <p>A: Although I don't currently have 5-10 years of software development experience, I'm naturally curious, highly motivated, dedicated to my craft, intelligent enough to succeed in this industry, and determined to get just a little bit better every day. As a bonus, I'm a loyal team player, I'm easy to work with, and I'll brighten your day with quips and amusing personal anecdotes.</p>
                    <p class="underline">Q: Do you have any interests outside of coding?</p>
                    <p>A: Yes! I'm an avid video gamer with a lifelong passion for Nintendo games (my current favorite is <i>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</i> for Nintendo Switch). I also love building Legos and model kits, solving puzzles (crossword, jigsaw, and sudoku), reading comics, and pencil sketching. I run, walk, and hike for exercise daily, and if invited to a potluck, I can bring a mean bowl of chili.</p>
