                    <div class="blog-post-content">
                        <p>I’m Rob Bock, a curious and open-minded software developer with a background in written communication and client-facing business operations... </p>
                        <p>...but you just read that on the Home page! Since I have a bit more space here, I'd like to tell you a little about myself, where I've been, and where I'm hoping to go.</p>
                        <p>I studied journalism in college -- I've always had a knack for writing, and I liked the idea of having a career that demanded investigation, research, and working quickly on creations to engage and excite large audiences. But shortly after graduating I realized that the journalism industry wasn't as fulfilling as I'd imagined, and I'd be better off in a different field with a wider variety of tasks and more room to grow.</p>
                        <p>For the next few years I worked at a custom apparel company called Custom Ink as a Satisfaction Assurance Associate, which was a hybrid role that combined Project Management with Customer Service. It was my job to resolve production issues relating to quality control by proofing designs, coordinating with coworkers in other departments, and reaching out to customers to resolve issues which would prevent their orders from being fulfilled. The highlight of my time at Custom Ink was when I earned a temporary internship with the Site Content department, which is where I first learned how websites are designed, developed, and deployed. Even though I didn't know how to write code, I was captivated by the entire process, and the experience reverberated in the back of my mind long after I returned to my previous position. But, after a few more years at Custom Ink, I found that I'd mastered the responsibilities of my role. Because I wasn't a coder, there weren't many other opportunities for me to advance, and so I decided to move on from the company in search of new challenges.</p>
                        <p>I later worked at a small but rapidly-growing baking company called Whisked, and my job was essentially a jack-of-all trades role where I did whatever tasks were needed to keep production operations running smoothly. I was happy to tackle such a wide array of responsibilities, but I couldn't stop thinking about finding a more permanent job that had everything I'd come to realize I needed... Something fast-paced, with endless opportunities for learning, ample room for growth, and the chance to create projects which would benefit people on a large scale. By this point, the answer was obvious: I should build websites! But first, I had to learn how to code.</p>
                        <p>I parted ways with Whisked in late 2020, and built my first web page shortly after. Needless to say, it was love at first <i>site</i>! I spent all of 2021 learning the many tools and techniques involved in web development, and I was delighted to find that Full-Stack Web Development and Software Engineering were closely intertwined due to various shared technologies. I figured learning both disciplines would maximize my chances of landing a role doing something I loved, so I enrolled in a Software Engineering program with General Assembly, and graduated in December 2021.</p> 
                        <p>The rest of my story is still to be written! But, if you're interested in helping me continue my journey, you can check out my resume <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UasTmB8fMGGtafXISSh4FZrjCh7CXvCQgxtKz2TCDVQ/">here.</a></p>
